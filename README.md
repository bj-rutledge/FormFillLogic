PDF Form Fill Logic for LWC Form Filler

This logic is for a pdf form filler API. I am unable to make the source of the API open; however, wanted to share how I solved some interesting problems, namely filling out complicated legal forms in PDF format. The code here is the meat and patatos of the API, it receives data objects, validates the data, then fills a GR39 form. The GR39 form is a complicated legal document that requests relief from crushing legal debt as a result of criminal convictions in the State of Washington.
